    <h1>Privacy Policy for World's smallest violin</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date: November 30, 2025</strong></p>
    
    <p>Marco Carrizales ("we", "us", or "our") operates the "World's smallest violin" mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information through the App.</p>
    
    <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect, store, or process any personal information from users of the App. The App does not require user accounts, logins, or any form of personal data input.</p>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services and Advertising</h2>
    <p>The App integrates Google AdMob for displaying advertisements. AdMob may collect and use certain anonymized information to serve ads, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device information (e.g., device type, OS version).</li>
        <li>Approximate location (derived from IP address).</li>
        <li>Advertising ID (e.g., Android Advertising ID) for personalized ad targeting.</li>
        <li>Usage data (e.g., app interactions for ad relevance).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is collected by Google and governed by their <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543">AdMob terms</a>. We do not access or store this data.</p>
    <p>Users in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland will see a consent form for personalized ads, as required by law. You can manage ad preferences in your device settings (e.g., reset Advertising ID or opt out of personalization).</p>
    
    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share any user data with third parties, except as handled by AdMob for ad serving. We may share aggregated, non-personal analytics with service providers for app improvement.</p>
    
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>Since we collect no personal data, there are no specific security measures for user information. However, we follow standard practices to protect the App.</p>
    
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>
    
    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since no personal data is collected, rights like access or deletion do not apply. For AdMob data, refer to Google's policies.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Policy. Changes will be posted here with a new effective date.</p>
